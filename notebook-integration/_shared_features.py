The feature extractor, as source text, shared by both notebook generators.

This exists for one reason: train/serve skew. If EmotionClassifier.ipynb
computes features one way and WhishperBackend.ipynb computes them another, the
classifier receives vectors that mean something different from the ones it
learned on, and accuracy collapses — silently, with no error, in a way that
looks like "the model just isn't very good".

Keeping one copy here and injecting it into both notebooks makes that class of
bug impossible rather than merely unlikely.

    One clip -> one fixed-length vector of prosodic and spectral statistics.

    Each block maps to something a listener actually hears as emotion:

      pitch (F0)     : angry and happy sit higher and vary more; sad is flat
      energy (RMS)   : angry is loud with sharp attacks; sad is quiet
      rhythm         : sad is slow with long pauses; angry is fast and clipped
      voice quality  : spectral shape separates tense from breathy
      MFCC           : timbre, the general-purpose backstop

    Deliberately *not* normalised per speaker: doing so would leak test-speaker
    statistics into training under a speaker-independent split.

    ## Why the waveform is peak-normalised first

    Without it, `rms_mean`, `rms_max`, `rms_range`, `rms_std`, `rms_slope` and
    `mfcc0_mean` all scale with the raw recording level — measured, a x0.15
    gain change moves them by about 85%. Those were also the six features the
    model ranked most important, so most of its decision was really "how loud
    is this file".

    That is fine within one corpus, where the recording chain is constant and
    loudness genuinely correlates with anger. It is fatal across corpora:
    UrduSER is broadcast television audio, normalised and compressed to a peak
    near 1.0, while a laptop microphone is far quieter. A model trained on the
    former and served the latter reads every clip as low-energy and scores
    *below chance* — which is exactly what happened.

    Normalising to unit peak throws away absolute level and keeps the shape:
    how much the energy varies, where it rises and falls, how peaky it is
    against its own maximum. That is the part that actually carries emotion,
    and it survives a change of microphone.

    Done here rather than in `load_and_trim` on purpose — the serving path
    passes an already-decoded waveform straight to this function, so anything
    done outside it would apply during training and not during serving.

    # shift purely from which frames happened to glitch. A 5-frame median
    # filter removes the spikes without smoothing real intonation, which
